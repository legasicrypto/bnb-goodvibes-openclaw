# USDC on BNB Smart Chain Testnet

For the hackathon demo we use a **mintable mock USDC (mUSDC, 6 decimals)** deployed on **BNB Smart Chain Testnet (chainId 97)**.

- mUSDC address: `0x31C007fD6597748dacde1e243A8ef1C083bbC8F4`
- Explorer: https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0x31C007fD6597748dacde1e243A8ef1C083bbC8F4

## How to get USDC for the demo

Use the in-app faucet (recommended):
- https://bnb.legasi.io/faucet → **Mint USDC** (or **Mint All Tokens**)

> Note: If contracts are redeployed, previously minted tokens may no longer match the active demo contracts. Mint fresh tokens in the faucet.

## Source of truth

See `docs/DEPLOYMENTS.md` for the full deployment table (core contracts + mock tokens).
